DESCRIPTION
    Spry is a JavaScript framework produced by Adobe. The following is taken
    from their website.

    *"The Spry framework for Ajax is a JavaScript library that provides
    easy-to-use yet powerful Ajax functionality that allows designers to
    build pages that provide a richer experience for their users.*

    *It is designed to take the complexity out of Ajax and allow designers
    to easily create Web 2.0 pages."*

    This package is used to generate simple HTML-formatted data sets that
    are consumable by Spry DataSet objects, for use in generating various
    dynamic JavaScript-driven page elements, such as dynamic tables, reports
    and so on.

    The SYNOPSIS section covers pretty much everything you need to know
    about using HTML::Spry::DataSet. All methods throw an exception on
    error.
